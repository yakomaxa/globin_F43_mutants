Lists of F43 mutanted globin structures.

2020/08/05

F43 residue is strongly conserved among globin family. 
This is a list of crystal structure of F43 myoglobin mutants.
They show alomost identical structures to wild-type myoglobin so that these mutations seem to have limted effects on the globin structrue and heme-bindability.
This makes it more mysterious why the F43 residue is strongly conserved. 

Be sure that this is not a comprehensive list; This is just my "what-I-have-found" list.
